# Bryce Visuality Guidelines.

Here are some guidelines for a methedology for visuality inspired by Bryce's subjectivity.

Space      - The region that defines the object of emotional interest.
Boundaries - The separation of spaces that makes them amenable to computation.
Paths      - The way of flow between the spaces.
Math       - The data structure that encompasses the structure and operations of the space, boundaries, and paths.
Light - The Agents moving within and between the spaces.
impressions - The portions of the activity that are perceived by the eye or the mind's eye.

Light is objective. Impressions are subjective.
